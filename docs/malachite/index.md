# Tutorial: malachite

Malachite is a **Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus engine** that helps distributed systems and applications reach agreement on shared data, even when some participants are faulty or malicious.  
It implements the _Tendermint consensus algorithm_, allowing multiple nodes to propose, vote, and decide on values (*e.g.*, blocks) in a robust and efficient way.  
The project is designed with modularity and flexibility in mind, using abstractions like a _Context trait_ for application-specific types, an _effect system_ to interact asynchronously with the environment, and an actor-based architecture for scalability and fault-tolerance.  
Malachite also supports various modes of propagating proposed data to optimize performance and ensures safety and recovery through write-ahead logging and synchronization protocols.
